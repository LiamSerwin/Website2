    <h1>Rats</h1>
      <p style= "text-indent: 40px;"> The rats kept getting out of their cages and into the raisin bran. We fired John soon after. He was the only one who ate raisin bran. 
The experiments were trivial. We cut zippers out of jackets and clamped them to the cage, doused them with chemicals, and classified the different ways they could unzip. 
</p>
      <p>We settled on four categories: </p>
      <p>1. Haste. Like when you're about to have sex.</p>
      <p>2. Suave. Like James Dean</p>
      <p>3. Morose. My personal favorite. Like when your jacket is the only thing giving you comfort, forced to be released.
</p>
      <p>4. Not going for the zipper at all, escaping the cage, and finding the nearest source of raisin bran.  
</p>
      <p>After discovering the latter, the rats had no interest in zipping or unzipping at all. Their entire feeble existence became focused on escape. We tried swapping out the rats, but they seemed to all be in communication. 
</p>
      <p> The best part of my day used to be watching their little paws sullenly grasp a zipper. Now my eyes hurt from staring at them constantly, and pushing them away from the latch. In a board meeting I had suggested that we refocus the study on the different ways they attempted escape. It was shot down immediately. Something about optics and shareholders. 
</p>
      <p>I was a glorified vermin babysitter. When people asked me what I’m doing with my time, I lied. I began to notice changes when it came to zipping up my jackets. I even tried to demonstrate to a group of rats how I liked to zip and unzip. Smoothly, with an edge of mystery, like even I didn’t know what was underneath. </p>
      <p class=" para1">

      </p>
      <p>The box juts slightly out of my pocket, giving my step a new gait to it. I hope no one will notice. The last board meeting had me walking aimlessly in the street. After some slight petulance and erratic annoyance from the head of the board, I discovered what we were really doing with these rats.
</p>
      <p> Now you would think as one of the scientists I would not only know, but be deeply situated. This is not the case with firms like ours. You get data and send it off. That didn’t keep me from guessing. I had it whittled down to something with motorskills, to allow paraplegics some grace when it came to their morning routines. 
</p>
      <p>
        I was wrong. We just made zippers. I told my sister company and she knew it well, which I took as a bad sign. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My answers must have been timid and rushed, as I had a crowd of my coworkers behind me asking politely to stop. It was too late. The gait got more noticeable. Their questions turned to statements. I locked the door behind me, met with pleas. I took the box out of my pocket and walked to the cages of rats. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a symphony of chirps. A metropolis. They each looked at me with what I can only describe as pity. Those beady little wonders. Like olives. Or caviar. 
      </p>
      <p>I ripped off the lid and let jagged contents pour. Watched as they all scurried towards it. Their little paws no longer looped in metal, now full of the finest raisin bran I could find.
