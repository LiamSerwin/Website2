    <h1>1/3/25 - Friday</h1>
        <p> Sitting at the bar at the Gaia Hotel in Anderson, California and I realize distraction is a social pressure.</p>
    <p>The bartender works her magic on those little black plastic nubby things. I can’t help but feel I’m doing something wrong. 
</p>
  <p>Like I was invading the space she existed in. As though the only socially acceptable option was to pull out my phone—which I’ve done now but for the purpose of concreting this thought—and disappear. 
</p>
  <p>She’s wearing an encrusted tank top that says MILF and won’t stop calling me hun.</p>

    <h1>7/7/25 - Monday </h1>
    <p> At the beach. Having to remember that I like the sun. I am at the beach. Donovan gave me his Dodgers hat since I forgot most everything. We all reapply sunscreen every few minutes. The rest of the group will get here sometime in the next hour, and we will want to leave. Caught a glimpse of myself in the reflection of the phone. I hate having those little prickly reminders jut out every 12 hours. 
        I do not know how to be away from the pulse. It’s so infectious. . I was telling Donny something about this on the way back from Hermosa Beach. </p>
 <p>“Mark Fisher had this thing he wrote about.” </p>
 <p>Donny nodded his head, “Mark Fisher.”</p>
 <p>“––What was that?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. Keep going.”</p>
<p>“It was about one of his students. How they were playing music into some wire headphones without evening listening. The kid said something about how he wanted to stay connected, and how the different webs of media make us feel like we always have to be involved––and even worse, that we like it.”</p>
 <p> You ever see the drummer from Rush?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. My dad showed me the dudes drumkit when I was kid.</p>
<p>“So cool.”</p>
<p>“So cool.”</p> 

<p>back of my knees ended up sunburnt. </p>
